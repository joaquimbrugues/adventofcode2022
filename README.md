# Advent of Code 2022

Very recently I discovered the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, and this is my humble attempt to solve all of them for 2022.

I chose [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) because I was looking for a challenge and the language seems to be full of possibilities.

Many thanks to the wonderful community at [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
